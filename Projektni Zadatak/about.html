            <h2>Who am I and why did I make this?</h2>

            <p>I am but a humble college student who felt the need to aid people who are unfamiliar with the game or simply want to try it out but don't know what it is. I was in the same spot like that years ago and I didn't have anyone to teach the game to me. Therefor I took the task upon myself to learn it myself in my free time. As soon as I found out that just the Player's Handbook is more then 300 pages long, I knew I am in for a long ride. Lucky for me, the book was pretty decently written and it was easy to understand what were they trying to say. The only issue was with remembering it all but that issue was resolved with simple time spent playing the game itself.</p>

            <p>As any others potential solo adventure into D&D, they started with Character Creation since that was what attracted most, if not all, people to try it out in the first place. Another glance at the Character Sheet showed even more unknown factors which was quite a lot to understand on its own. That is when I turned my attention to videos made on YouTube on how to make your own character. The videos were quite long and I wasn't able to understand everything right off the bat but in the end I did make a character after 2 hours and... it was bad. I still have the sheet to this day and when I look back with my current knowledge it wouldn't pass for a decent sheet what so ever. So if anyone out there is having trouble, keep in mind that you are not the only one but you will succeed eventually with hard work and dedication. Once I found my own formula for creating characters, I had little to no issues with it. As long as I know what I am making, it will be done in not time flat.</p>

            <p>And this brings us to now, this whole place was created from a GM and somewhat of a Player from time to time, for Players and those who want to be a GM. It is still in its early stages so there might not be much to look at but eventually it will be able to contain enough helpful tools for anyone to be able to create their own character in their own way they might desire. This place won't by any means overrule what someone's Game Master might say, so make sure to ask your GM before using anything you may find from this place. As long as I am able to help one person to achieve their goals by using this site, I would be satisfied. My experience in the game for the past five years is not much but if there is anything I've learned in my life is that there is always a way to achieve your goals, and if there is not, then just make your own path instead!</p>
