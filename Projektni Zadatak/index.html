            <h2>What is D&D 5E anyways?</h2>

            <p>Dungeons & Dragons is a Table Top Roleplaying game that started from the year 1974 and it is played in various ways to this day. It is no wonder it got so much popular over the years considering the fact how much freedom each player has in playing the game. Each individual party, or even the adventure itself could end in a completely different way. The highest selling point to even consider to play such game is "You are able to do whatever you want"! In this particular situation, I will be talking about the 5th edition.</p>

            <p>In order to even play the game, you will only need few dice, your imagination, will power, and of course, some players. Each game consists of two different players, a Game Master (or GM for short) and a Player. The Player controls his own Player Character and plays in the world controlled by the Game Master. The GM does not have their own character in particular, but controls everything what is going on around the Player which includes the environment and Non-Player Character(s). The goal of the game is... not specific. Depending on what kind of adventure you may be embarking on, your goal could be killing an Ancient Red Dragon, or perhaps raiding an ancient dungeon of an old Lich. The game itself doesn't have to have any Dungeons or even Dragons. It all depends on the GM and sometimes the Players too.</p>

            <p>There is most of the time only one player playing as the GM but there could be multiple players. My personal opinion is that there should be 4 Players in a party. That doesn't mean that some other party might have more or less people in it but a 1 to 4 ratio usually gives the sweet spot for the game. If someone is a beginner GM, I highly recommend not having more then 4 people in the party. Keep in mind that each player might be doing their thing, and with no experience the new GM could be overwhelmed since there is only one GM. Furthermore, each Player would need to have their own Character Sheet and maybe a Spell Sheet depending on what kind of character the Player might be playing. Aside from that, it would be good to have one set of dice. One basic set of dice for playing D&D 5E consists of a 20, 12, two 10, 8, 6 and 4 sided dice. Although everyone could share one set of dice, having more dice is a common thing for each Player to possess. No one can have enough dice at any point in time, or so people at least say. Keep in mind that this is all needed if you are playing in person. There are also multiple sites to play the game online in a sandbox environment. I personally currently use "roll20.net". And that would be about it, the rules might be daunting at first but with some reading a bit of work anyone can learn how to play the game in their own way. The rule book which is suggested for beginners would be The Player Handbook (or PHB for short). It is not needed to fallow the rules to the letter as long as everyone is having fun at the table.</p>
