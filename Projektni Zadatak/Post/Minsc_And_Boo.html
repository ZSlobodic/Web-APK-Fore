    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>“Back when me and Boo caught the Calishite itch, Boo said we should start a journal. But his paws were tiny and ink got everywhere...including places that I should not write down here. So I, Minsc, decided to write down our adventures to prove that the pen is not mightier than the sword! With Boo's help, we wrote about every den of stinking evil that was found, every wicked butt that was kicked, and lots more besides!</p>
    <p>Me and Boo thought the journal would help other heroes see how good and fun it is to smash and smite evil, so we asked our friend Volo to publish it. But Volo said something about it being childlike gibberish and in need of an "editor". He said he would edit it for us, but only if we helped him out with a book he was writing. Why would Volo write a book on monsters? He has never gone butt-kicking in the name of righteousness! But me and Boo are always eager to help a friend, so monster hunting we went.</p>
    <p>Monster hunting was fun, as it always is. Boo has a nose that can sniff out evil, so sniffing out monsters was as easy for my little friend as sniffing out squirrels in heat. We mostly killed cockatrices and basilisks, because we hate creatures that turn you to stone. Being turned to stone is no fun. No fun at all.</p>
    <p>We returned to Volo with monster carcasses and our writings on the joy of giving evil the backhand of justice. Volo got all red in the face. He said something about how I ignored the "list" he had given me. I think he meant the paper that Boo used on his furry backside while we were on the road.</p>
    <p>It all worked out in the end. I just had to promise not to talk to our good friend Volo for one hundred years. But one hundred years can fly by when you're not looking. Me and Boo know this from experience...”</p>
